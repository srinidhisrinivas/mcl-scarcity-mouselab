The color of the text can be one of <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">red</span>, <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">blue</span>, <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">green</span> or <span style="color:yellow; font-weight:bold; text-shadow: 0.07em 0 black, 0 0.07em black, -0.07em 0 black, 0 -0.07em black;">yellow</span>. Accordingly, you must press the corresponding key to report the color you see:
