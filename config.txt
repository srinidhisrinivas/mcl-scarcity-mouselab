####################### Psiturk Configuration Defaults #########################
#
# Example config file. Uncomment lines (remove the `;`)
# in order to override defaults.
#

############################ HIT Configuration #################################
[HIT Configuration]
# REG: We don't post these HITs using psiturk when using Cloudresearch or Prolific.
# REG: So we remove options which only apply to that.

# A list of web browsers, delineated by commas, that mturkers may _not_ use to
# perform the hit.
#
# The following possible values are checked by using properties on the `user_agents` python library.
#     possible values : mobile, tablet, touchcapable, pc, bot, safari
#
# Example of excluding Microsoft Internet Explorer:
#     browser_exclude_rule = MSIE
# otherwise, the string is checked against the user_agent_string. Example, to exclude
# internet explorer:
#      browser_exclude_rule : MSIE
#
# By default, MISE, mobile, and tablet are all excluded
browser_exclude_rule = MSIE, mobile, tablet

# Whether workers can perform the hit multiple times. Enforced by the psiturk
# server; not by mturk.
# REG: CHANGE THIS! Should be "true" when using the Turkprime route, otherwise select for naïveté with "false".

############################## Database Parameters #############################
[Database Parameters]
# Participant data will be stored in this database.
# If ON_CLOUD=1, then this defaults to env var $DATABASE_URL, if set.
# REG: This should be set on Heroku or in the environment variables when not using Docker.

# Local database URL
#database_url = sqlite:///participants.db

# psiTurk creates several database tables to store data and to manage aspects of
# automated tasks, campaigns, etc...
# if multiple users share the same database these value need to be changed to be
# unique for each experiment.

# If ON_CLOUD env var is set, then these both default to stdout (-)

# The psiturk (gunicorn) server can optionally serve traffic over https. This is
# normally not necessary if the psiturk server is set up behind a reverse proxy
# server, as is the default case with cloud hosting providers such as heroku.
#
# In reverse-proxy situations,
# the reverse proxy communicates with web browsers and other clients over https,
# while communicating on the backend with the gunicorn server over http. The
# psiturk server would only be listening on localhost and would not serve
# traffic directly.
#
# To have gunicorn use https, set both the `certfile` and `keyfile` below to point
# to a project-relative path to the public and private keys respectively.

################################## Task Parameters #############################
# Settings used by various task Flask routes
[Task Parameters]
# The code_version for the task. Logged as a field in the database for each
# participant, useful for data analysis. The random balanced assignment depends

# Can be any string value -- recommended to use semantic versioning for analysis
# sanity.
# REG: CHANGE THIS!

# The number of possible treatments. Used for random balanced assignment.
# REG: CHANGE THIS!
num_conds = 2

# If you don't know what this is, it is safe to leave it at a default of 1 and
# to only modify `num_conds` above.

contact_email_on_error = re-mturk@tuebingen.mpg.de

# Maximum expected time for a participant to complete the task.
# Exclusively used in determining random assignment -- basically, how long should
# a participant be given to complete the task after starting? How long should the
# task last? This is different than the `duration` specified when running
# `hit create`, because a participant may not start the task immediately after
# accepting it, while the hit `duration` starts ticking as soon as the hit is
# accepted (some workers queue their accepted hits before starting it).
