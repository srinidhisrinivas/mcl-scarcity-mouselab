# MCL Scarcity Experiment

(forked from [this repo](https://github.com/RationalityEnhancementGroup/mouselab-mdp-example/tree/jsPsych-v7.2.1) for the purposes of defining a single experiment)

This experiment uses the Mouselab-MDP paradigm (see link above) to investigate a hindering factor of meta-cognitive learning, namely scarcity. If many actions made by the agent go unrewarded, how might learning be affected by this?
